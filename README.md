<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

The Card Verify app is a React-based tool designed to validate and identify credit card numbers. It simplifies the process of determining whether a card number is valid and accurately detects the card type (Visa, MasterCard, Discover) based on industry-standard patterns.

The app ensures robust validation using the **[<u>Luhn algorithm</u>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm)**, checking for both card type compatibility and number integrity. It features a clean and intuitive interface, real-time feedback on user input, and dynamic updates for detected card types. The app demonstrates best practices in React development, modular architecture, and scalable deployment strategies.

Please check **[<u>link</u>](https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_GB/vhelp/paypalmanager_help/credit_card_numbers.htm)** for the sample credit card numbers.
